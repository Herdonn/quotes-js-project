object-oriented programming,https://hackernoon.com/exploring-dart-fundamentals-part-5-inheritance-and-method-overriding-in-dart,"Exploring Dart Fundamentals - Part 5: Inheritance and Method Overriding Sadanand Gadwal @sadanandgadwal Too Long; Didn't Read Sadanand Gadwal     @ sadanandgadwal     Definition and Importance: Inheritance is a core principle of object-oriented programming where a new class,  called a subclass or derived class, can inherit properties and methods  from an existing class, known as a superclass or base class. Example Clarification: Real-World Analogy: An  analogy to explain inheritance could be a ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù superclass, with  ‚Äúcar‚Äù and ‚Äútruck‚Äù subclasses inheriting common features like wheels and  engines but having their distinct properties and behaviors.         The   the class represents a basic car with a   property and a   method.         Definition and Purpose: Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a  method that is already defined in its superclass. This enables  subclasses to tailor behavior to their specific needs while maintaining a  common interface. Example Explanation: Use Cases: Method overriding is commonly used in scenarios where a subclass needs to  customize behavior inherited from its superclass, such as providing  specialized functionality for different types of vehicles.         Practical Demonstration: Real-World Relevance: Understanding inheritance and method overriding is essential for designing modular,  maintainable, and extensible software systems, particularly in complex  applications where classes and hierarchies abound     In the   function, we create an instance of   and call its   method. Since the   method is overridden in the   class, it prints ""Driving an electric car"".     This  demonstrates how inheritance and method overriding work in Dart,  allowing for code reuse and the ability to specialize behavior in  sub classes. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building  maintainable and extensible object-oriented Dart applications. üåü Stay Connected! üåü Hey there, awesome reader! üëã Want to stay updated with my latest insights,Follow me on social media!

object-oriented programming,https://hackernoon.com/solid-principles-in-java-a-beginners-guide,"SOLID Principles In Java: A Beginner's Guide Pratik Singhal @ps06756 Too Long; Didn't Read Pratik Singhal     @ ps06756 Hi, I am Pratik! I am Senior Software Engineer @ Amazon and an educator. STORY‚ÄôS CREDIBILITY Guide Walkthroughs, tutorials, guides, and tips. This story will teach you how to do something new or how to do something better. SOLID design principles are the most important design principles you need to know to write clean code. Having a solid command over SOLID principles is an indispensable skill for any programmer. They are the foundation on which other design patterns are developed.     In this article, we will tackle the SOLID design principles using some real-life examples and understand their importance.     Together with Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Inheritance, SOLID Principles are really important to be good at objective-oriented programming. Why Are SOLID Principles Important? SOLID principles are important for multiple reasons:                 Let‚Äôs now explore each of the SOLID principles in detail with real-world examples. 1. Single Responsibility Principle S in SOLID principles stands for Single Responsibility Principle. The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only a single reason to change. This limits the number of places we need to make changes when incorporating additional requirements in our project. Each class should have exactly one reason to change. For example, let‚Äôs say we are designing a banking application in Java where we have a   class that allows basic operations like debit, credit, and  . The   method takes an enum called   (like Email, SMS, etc.) and sends the update with the appropriate medium. We will write the code for that as shown below.             Now, if you look at the   class above, it can change due to multiple reasons:     If there is any change in the core logic of    class (like  ,  , etc.).     If the bank decides to introduce a new Notification medium (let‚Äôs say WhatsApp).     This is a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle in SOLID Principles. To fix, it we will make a separate class that sends the notification.     Let‚Äôs refactor the code above according to the SOLID Principles                 Now, since we have refactored the code, if there is any change in the   or the format, we will change the   class. However, if there is a change in the core logic of  , there will be changes in the   class.     This fixes the violation that we observed in the first example. 2. Open/Close Principle The Open Close principle states that we should design the classes in such a way so that they are open for extension (in case of adding additional features) but closed for modification. Being closed for modification helps us in two ways:             To see an example of the Open Close Principle, let‚Äôs take a look at the example of a shopping cart (such as the one implemented on e-commerce websites).     I am going to create a class called as   which will contain a list of  (s) that you can add to it. Depending on the type of item, and the taxation on it we want to create a method that calculates the total cart value inside the   class.     Classes should be open for extension and closed for modification             In the above example,   method calculates the cart value by iterating over all the items inside the cart and invoking logic based on the type of item.     Although this code looks correct, it violates the SOLID Principles.     Let‚Äôs say we need to add a new rule for a different type of item (say Grocery) while calculating cart value. In that case, we would have to modify the original class   and write another   condition inside it which checks for items of type  .     However, with little refactoring, we can make the code adhere to the open/close principle. Let‚Äôs see how.     First, we will make the   class abstract and make concrete classes for different types of  (s) as shown below.                     Inside each concrete Item classes like   ,  ,  and  implement the   method which contains the business logic for the taxation and value calculation.     Now, we will make the   class depend on the abstract class   and invoke the   method for each item as shown below.         Now, in this refactored code, even if new types of  (s) are introduced, the   class remains unchanged. Due to polymorphism, whatever is the actual type of the   inside the     , that class‚Äôs   method would be invoked. 3. Liskov‚Äôs Substitution Principle Liskov‚Äôs substitution principle states that in a given code, even if we replace the object of a superclass with an object of the child class, the code shouldn‚Äôt break. In other words, when a subclass inherits a superclass and overrides its methods, it should maintain consistency with the behavior of the method in the super class.     For example, if we make the following classes   and two classes   and   class. Now, let‚Äôs say we create a method called as   within the Vehicle class, it can be overridden in   class, but it will be unsupported in the   class as   doesn‚Äôt have an engine (see code sample below)     The subclass should maintain consistency with the behavior of the superclass when overriding methods.     Now, let‚Äôs say there is some code that expects an object of type vehicle and relies on the   method. If, while calling that piece of code instead of passing an object of type   we pass a   object, it would lead to issues in the code. Since the  (s) class‚Äôs method will throw an exception when the   method is called. This would be a violation of the SOLID Principles (Liskov‚Äôs substitution principle)     To resolve this issue, we can create two classes   and   and have   inherit from the   class and have   inherit from          4. Interface Segregation Principle The ‚ÄúI‚Äù in SOLID Principles stands for the Interface Segregation Principle.     The Interface segregation principle states that rather than having bigger interfaces that force implementing classes to implement unused methods, we should have smaller interfaces and have classes implemented. This way, classes only implement the relevant methods and remain clean. Divide your interfaces into multiple smaller interfaces rather than one big interface. For example, let‚Äôs look at the built-in Collections framework in Java. Among other data structures, Java also provides   and   data structure,      class implements the following interface(s):  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .  class implements  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .     That‚Äôs quite a lot of interfaces!     Rather than having so many interfaces, Java developers could have combined  ,  ,   ,  ,  , and   into one interface, let‚Äôs say   interface. Now, both   and   classes could have implemented this new   interface.     However, since   does not support random access, it could have implemented the methods in the   interface and could have thrown   when somebody tries to call it.     However, that would be a violation of the Interface Segregation principle in SOLID Principles as it would ‚Äúforce‚Äù the LinkedList class to implement the methods inside the   interface even though not required.     Therefore, it is better to split the interface based on the common behavior and let each class implement many interfaces rather than one big interface. Dependency Inversion Principle The Dependency Inversion Principle states that classes at the upper level shouldn‚Äôt directly depend on the classes at the lower level.  This causes a tight coupling b/w the two levels.     Instead of that, lower classes should provide an interface on which the upper-level classes should depend.     Depend on interfaces rather than classes     For example, let‚Äôs continue with the   example we saw above and enhance it to add some payment options. Let‚Äôs assume we have two types of payment options with us   and   . Now, in the   class, we want to add a method to   which would calculate the cart value and initiate the payment based on the supplied payment. method.     To do this, we could have added dependency in the   example above by adding the two payment options as fields inside the   class. However, that would tightly couple the   class with   and   class.     Instead of that, we would create a   interface and have both the   and   classes implement the   interfaces. Now, the   class will depend on the   interface, and not the individual payment types. This keeps the classes loosely coupled.     See the code below.

I share content for general software engineering and C#/dotnet development/ STORY‚ÄôS CREDIBILITY Original Reporting This story contains new, firsthand information uncovered by the writer.     Implicit operators in   allow us to define custom type conversions that happen ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî implicitly when working with multiple types. Implicitly in this case means that we don‚Äôt have to explicitly cast the types since the implicit operators we implement handle this for us.     Implicit operators in C# play a role in simplifying data type conversions. They enable you to convert one type to another seamlessly without explicitly casting the values. This feature can save you time and effort and improve the readability of code, but like all things we look at, there are cons to consider as well.     Throughout this article, we‚Äôll   and examine code examples to illustrate their practical application. Let‚Äôs dive right in and learn all about implicit operators in C#! What are Implicit Operators in C#? Implicit operators in C# are a powerful feature that allows objects of one type to be automatically converted to another type without the need for an explicit cast. They provide a way to seamlessly convert between types, making code more concise and readable.     Implicit operators are defined as special methods within a class or struct, using the   keyword. These methods specify the conversion from one type to another. When the compiler encounters an assignment or expression involving compatible types, it will automatically invoke the appropriate implicit operator to perform the conversion.     Here‚Äôs an example to illustrate the concept:     In this example, we have a   type with a   property. We define an implicit operator in the   type that converts a   value to  . When we assign a   value to a   variable, the compiler automatically invokes the implicit operator, converting the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.     Implicit operators in C# can greatly simplify code by allowing objects to be converted implicitly when appropriate. This can make code more readable and reduce the need for explicit type conversions. However, it‚Äôs important to use implicit operators with caution and ensure that the conversion is safe and logical. Check out this video on using Implicit Operators in C# for more information: Pros and Cons of Implicit Operators in C# Like everything we look at, there are going to be pros and cons. I try to make sure that every topic we cover together on both my site and   looks at multiple perspectives. In my opinion, this is the best way to understand when things are a better or worse fit. Pros of Implicit Operators in C# Implicit operators in C# provide several benefits in software development. They can simplify code and improve readability by allowing automatic type conversions without requiring explicit casting or conversion methods. This eliminates the need for repetitive and potentially error-prone code, making the codebase more concise and easier to understand.     Consider the following example where we have a custom type,  , representing a unit of measurement that we‚Äôre working with:     With the implicit operators defined, we can use this custom type in calculations without explicitly converting them to their underlying types:     An important note here is that probably any quantity that has a value like this would need to indicate the unit of measurement ‚Äî this is omitted in this example just because you could do this in a number of ways and I don‚Äôt want that to be the focus. So there‚Äôs an assumption in this example that we DO know what unit we‚Äôre working with here.     The implicit conversion thanks to the operator that we added simplifies the code by reducing the number of explicit conversions and improves readability by expressing the intent more clearly. If we had to litter mathematical statements with (double) and other casts throughout it, it starts to detract from the understanding of the expression itself. Cons of Implicit Operators in C# One of the big cons of implicit operators is very much related to one of the pros that we looked at. The fact that we CAN implicitly convert can lend itself to very odd situations if we‚Äôre not careful about what we implicitly convert to.     Let‚Äôs introduce another custom type that can also be cast to a double. We can make a similar assumption as before that we know the units of this quantity-representing type. Here‚Äôs the code, very much like the previous type:     Because both   we have the power to write mathematical expressions like this without casting ‚Äî but should we?     In this example, the implicit operators allow the multiplication between   and   objects to be performed directly, without the need for explicit conversions. In isolation, it may have made more sense to allow for either type to be convertible to double, but when they both can be, the results may be unexpected.     To elaborate, with an example where in isolation if your length was meters, casting them to a double called length in meters isn‚Äôt too much of a stretch. But double itself is unitless, and when we start compounding this by mixing in other types, the burden of tracking what unit we‚Äôre *actually* talking about starts outweighing the benefit of the implicit conversion. In my opinion, it would be much more readable if we were forced to explicitly cast and track the conversions in intermediate steps if necessary.     This is of course one example, but the point is that if you are doing implicit conversions where you potentially lose data resolution (in this case, units), then you‚Äôre at risk of this sort of thing. Nothing prevents us as C# developers from doing this ‚Äî except maybe other developers on pull requests and code reviews! Use Cases for Implicit Operators In this section, I‚Äôll present three practical use cases for implicit operators in C#. Implicit operators are a powerful feature that allow for automatic conversion between different types. Understanding and utilizing implicit operators can greatly simplify your code and improve its readability. Let‚Äôs explore three use cases where implicit operators can be useful in C#. Converting Custom Types ‚Äì Money on My Mind One of the primary use cases for implicit operators is converting custom types. Suppose we have a custom type  , which represents a some amount of currency. We may want to allow implicit conversion from   to   to simplify calculations and enable direct comparisons. Here‚Äôs how we can define an implicit operator to achieve this:     By defining an implicit conversion operator from   to  , we can now directly assign a   object to a   variable without the need for explicit type casting. If you wanted to have financial calculations that were more expressive by having a   type, this could be useful without forcing casting operations everywhere. Simplifying Math Operations Implicit operators can also simplify math operations by automatically converting operands to compatible types. Let‚Äôs say we have a type   representing complex numbers, and we want to perform arithmetic operations on them. By using implicit operators, we can seamlessly convert integers and doubles to   when performing mathematical operations. In this case, we‚Äôll not only need implicit operators for converting, but we‚Äôll need an operator for doing arithmetic between two   instances.     Here‚Äôs an example:     With implicit operators, we can perform mathematical operations on   objects using integers or doubles without explicit conversions. If you were creating an application where there was a lot of arithmetic with these concepts, you may find that it improves the readability of your code to not have to routinely cast. Conversions with Other Libraries: A Geometry Example Implicit operators can be particularly useful when working with libraries or APIs that have different types representing similar concepts. By creating implicit operators between these types, you can seamlessly convert between them and simplify interactions with the library.     For example, consider a library we‚Äôd like to create that provides different types for representing points in 2D space. The library may define   and   types, each with its own set of operations. By defining implicit operators between these types, you make it easier for users to work with these objects interchangeably, depending on the context:     With these implicit operators in place, users can seamlessly convert between   and   objects, depending on the needs of their code:     In this scenario, implicit operators simplify the code and make it more expressive by allowing users to work with the same underlying data with different objects representing different concepts. There may be benefits in similar situations where we‚Äôre incorporating a third-party library into our code base, and want to offer a level of flexibility when interacting with it. For the types that we own, we could provide implicit conversions to the library in question, and it may simplify logic within our codebase when interacting with the library. Wrapping Up Implicit Operators in C# In this article, we explored implicit operators in C#, and how they can simplify code and improve code readability. Implicit operators allow for automatic conversions between different types, making it easier to work with data and objects in C#.     My personal opinion on implicit operators in C# is that type conversion is easy to ‚Äúget wrong‚Äù. If you‚Äôre not sure what you‚Äôre doing, I think it‚Äôs an easy thing that you could mess up and create more complications in your code than it‚Äôs worth getting potential readability out of it. However, if you‚Äôre creating code that has an emphasis on working between several types as the core of what you‚Äôre doing, you may have better insights into effective ways to use these properly.

We‚Äôll focus on C# for beginners here, so if you‚Äôre already familiar with how to write code in C# this is probably not for you. But if you‚Äôre just starting out‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre in the right spot!     Throughout this article, I‚Äôll guide you through five  , each with its own code example. These cover the very basics of C# to provide you with a solid foundation in C# programming. By the end of this article, you‚Äôll not only understand these concepts but also be able to apply them in your first C# programs.     Let‚Äôs get started with these beginner C# concepts! Beginner Concepts in C# In this section, I‚Äôll cover five beginner concepts in C# that are important for new   to understand. These concepts form the basics of C# and are important for building robust and efficient applications. By understanding these concepts, you‚Äôll be well on your way to writing your very own applications! Variables and Data Types in CSharp Variables are used to store and manipulate data in C#. They allow you to give names to values and refer to them later in your code. In C#, variables must have a data type, which defines the type of data that can be stored in that variable. Common data types in C# include integers (int), strings (string), and booleans (bool).     Here‚Äôs an example of declaring and initializing variables:     In the above code, we declare three variables:   of type int,   of type string, and   of type bool. We also initialize them with specific values. Understanding variables and   is important for performing calculations, manipulating data, and representing real-world information in your programs. Conditionals and Loops in CSharp Conditionals and loops are important ‚Äúcontrol flow‚Äù structures in C# that allow you to make decisions and repeat sections of code based on certain conditions. Conditionals, such as if statements, enable you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met. Loops, such as   and  , allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times until a condition is no longer true.     Here‚Äôs an example of using conditionals and loops in C#:     In the above code, we use an if statement to check whether   is positive, negative, or zero. The for loop is used to iterate five times and print the current iteration number. The while loop prints the value of   until it becomes zero. Conditionals and loops are powerful tools for controlling the flow of your program and executing code based on specific conditions. Methods and Functions in CSharp Methods and functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to encapsulate functionality, improve code organization, and promote code reusability. Methods can take parameters, perform operations, and return values. In C#, methods are defined using the   keyword if they don‚Äôt return a value or a specific return type if they do.     Here‚Äôs an example of creating and calling a method in C#:     In the above code, we define a method   that takes a   parameter and prints a greeting message. We also define a method   that takes two integer parameters   and   and returns their sum. We then call these methods with specific arguments. Methods and functions are important building blocks of C# programs and allow you to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces.     If you want to learn more about C#, I have a  . Check it out! [Affiliate] Getting Started: C# - Dometrain Course     Arrays and Lists in CSharp Arrays and lists are data structures used to store collections of elements in C#. Arrays have a fixed size, while lists can dynamically grow and shrink as needed. Both arrays and lists can store elements of the same type, such as integers or strings. They provide convenient ways to access, manipulate, and  .     Here‚Äôs an example of using arrays and lists in C#:     In the above code, we create an array   that stores five integer values. We access and print the first number using the index  . We also create a list   that initially doesn‚Äôt contain any elements. We use the   method to add three names to the list and access and print the first name using the index  . One of the big differentiators between these two is that arrays are intended to be for fixed size collections and lists are designed to change in size.     Arrays and lists are fundamental data structures in C# and are used extensively in various programming tasks. I use them every single day! Classes and Objects in CSharp Classes and objects are the foundation of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C#. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects, whereas an object is an instance of a class. Classes allow you to model real-world entities and define their properties (fields) and actions (methods). Objects can be created from classes and have their own unique state and behavior.     Here‚Äôs an example of creating a class and an object in C#:     In the above code, we define a class   with a   field and a   field. We also define a constructor that sets the initial values of these fields. The   method starts the engine for the car and prints a message. We create an object   of type   using the constructor and call the   method on it. Classes and objects allow you to create modular and reusable code in C#, enabling you to build complex systems with ease. Wrapping Up C# For Beginners We‚Äôve explored five beginner concepts in C# and you‚Äôve been provided with some simple code examples to illustrate each one. Each of these concepts help to cover some of the fundamentals of C#, and in fact, you‚Äôll find variations of these in other programming languages as well.     We started by discussing the concept of variables and data types, highlighting the importance of properly defining and using them in C# programs. Next, we checked out control flow statements, which allow us to make decisions and repeat actions based on certain conditions. We then explored the concept of arrays and lists, which enable us to store and manipulate collections of related data items. Functions were next on our list where we learned how to encapsulate reusable code blocks. And lastly, I discussed the concept of classes and objects, which form the basis of object-oriented programming in C#.     I encourage you to continue your learning journey with C#. There is always more to explore and discover in this language, and after nearly two decades of using it, I still learn every day.

object-oriented programming,https://hackernoon.com/actor-model-for-object-oriented-programmers,"Actor Model For Object Oriented Programmers Joel Lopes @joellopes Too Long; Didn't Read Joel Lopes     @ joellopes Over 14 years of experience developing distributed cloud applications     The Actor Model offers Object-Oriented Programmers a new way of thinking. The Actor Model is a paradigm for   in which actors represent state and behavior in a way that's similar to classes. Actors serve as basic components that embody state and behavior.     This article focuses on the basic ideas of the Actor Model along with its advantages and possible uses in developing concurrent, scalable systems. The goal is to help developers understand these concepts to build robust and responsive software solutions. Actor system Fig 1: Actor system overview     In a typical actor model system each actor has an associated mailbox. Communication happens mainly via the mailbox. When an actor receives a message, it can perform computations, update its internal state, and send messages to other actors in response. Actors operate asynchronously, so they can continue processing messages without waiting for a response. Actors work in parallel, communicate asynchronously, and do not explicitly share state. This asynchronous, message-driven approach enables highly scalable and fault-tolerant systems, as actors can be distributed across multiple processors or machines, and failures in one actor do not necessarily impact the entire system.     Key Principles of the Actor Model The fundamental ideas of the Actor Model set it apart from conventional object-oriented programming. Actors work in parallel to allow for autonomous task completion. To promote loose coupling, asynchronous messaging takes the place of direct class-to-class interactions. To prevent race problems in asynchronous systems, state isolation guarantees that each actor maintains a distinct state. Transparency about these actor locations makes it easier to distribute actors among several host machines. These are the foundation for the Actor Model. Let's take a look at these principles in detail :     The Actor Model was designed focusing on the systems that handle multiple users at once so the scalability was an important part. Consider the scenario of an e-commerce application with numerous users updating their shopping carts concurrently. In the actor model world, each shopping cart is represented as an independent actor, operating asynchronously. This concurrent execution ensures efficient handling of tasks without creating bottlenecks or race conditions. As we delve deeper into the Actor Model, the importance of concurrency becomes increasingly apparent, offering a powerful solution for applications operating at scale.     Communication among actors shifts from conventional class-to-class interactions. The Actor model uses asynchronous messaging instead of direct method calls. Unlike the usual practice of one class instantiating another and making direct method calls, actors exclusively rely on asynchronous messages for communication. This assures loose coupling by granting actors independence without needing to know¬† the internal mechanisms of their counterparts. Asynchronous communication is often achieved using message brokers which simplify complexity and enhance the overall agility of the system.     State isolation is a key idea in the Actor Model. Every actor in the system has an autonomous state that sets them apart from other actors. Due to state isolation, race conditions are less likely in the asynchronous systems, where changes happen quickly. Traditional models may find it difficult to synchronize state changes among concurrent entities, but the Actor Model avoids these problems by giving each actor autonomy over state management. This method makes the coordination of various tasks within the wider application architecture easier while also improving system stability.     There are three different modes of interaction in the actor model.         Actor Model Use Cases The Actor Model can be useful in a variety of applications, in scenarios that demand specific architectural considerations. The actor model‚Äôs concurrency can be beneficial in e-commerce applications to process shopping carts. Streaming applications can leverage the model's capacity for handling continuous data streams efficiently. Concurrent applications, particularly those requiring the support of numerous users simultaneously, can benefit from scalability. Additionally, systems demanding high availability, high reliability, and scalability can leverage the Actor Model due to its embedded fail safety, fault tolerance, and redundancy.     When to Use and Not to Use the Actor Model Knowing when to use the Actor Model is essential to developing software that's effective. Applications needing flowing data, high concurrency, and complicated workflows are where the actor model would shine. It might not be the best option for non-concurrent systems or applications that require high performance, like those that require millisecond execution rates, because of the unpredictable message delivery time. Before using the actor model, developers need careful evaluation of their application‚Äôs requirements.     Drawbacks and Risks The Actor Model has many advantages, but it has some drawbacks as well. The major concern is creating an architecture with many players and no central controller. A central controller ensures correct operation and gives an overall perspective of the system by keeping an eye on the actors. Without a central controller, systems become difficult to control and understand, which may result in problems with behavior and composition. Additionally, testing and debugging become more difficult due to the asynchronous and independent nature of actor behavior, so careful consideration of system design and actor quantity is needed.     Frameworks/Libraries Several frameworks/libraries provide support for building systems backed by Actor models. If you have a programming language of your choice there is probably an Actor model library for it.     Here are some examples, but not limited to:     Summary Actor Model proves to be an effective model for software architecture, providing solutions to the issues of scalability and concurrency. Its location transparency, state isolation, and loose coupling concepts help build flexible and responsive systems. For systems that need concurrent, scalable, and fault-tolerant architectures, the Actor Model is a useful tool, but careful attention is required, especially for testing and debugging. Developers that use this model must be dedicated to understanding its subtleties to effectively integrate it within the system of modern software development. For best outcomes, it's critical to balance the number of actors and take system architecture into account.

object-oriented programming,https://hackernoon.com/asynchronous-initialization-in-c-overcoming-constructor-limitations,"Asynchronous Initialization in C#: Overcoming Constructor Limitations Aleksei @fairday Too Long; Didn't Read Company  Mentioned Aleksei     @ fairday Hey, I am Alex, a dedicated Software Development Engineer with experience in the .NET environment and architecture STORY‚ÄôS CREDIBILITY Guide Walkthroughs, tutorials, guides, and tips. This story will teach you how to do something new or how to do something better. What is the problem? Async await syntax gives us the most straightforward way to write asynchronous code. However, such construction cannot be used in certain scenarios. For instance, using async await keywords is prohibited in constructors.     There are many reasons why it is not possible in the existing language version. Probably, one of the obvious ones is that async methods would return   or   to be able to properly handle exceptions without crashing the process, and trivially to be able to wait until the async operation is completed.     And if we simply take the following class, build the library containing it, and then look at disassembled code.     We will see the following line.     where   the keyword indicates that the method is an instance method, meaning it is called on an instance of the class, not on the class itself (which would be indicated by the static keyword).     So, technically, it calls some method (constructor) on the already existing object to initialize it. Could it be made asynchronous hypothetically? Of course, yes, everything is possible in our world; it only depends on the price and whether it will solve any real problem without introducing new complications and tradeoffs.     I believe that   developers have had discussions about it many times, and they clearly understand the feasibility and meaningfulness of incorporating this change.     However, even without language in-built such a feature, we can solve this problem. Ways to overcome There are plenty of approaches that could be used to achieve the asynchronous initialization. Async to sync If we are only allowed to have sync operation in constructors, we can intuitively apply the   approach. This approach is not so bad if there is no synchronization context in place and the async operation is relatively fast, but in general, it is not a recommended practice since it is based on a lot of assumptions about the executing environment and details of the async operation. It leads to inefficient resource consumption, sudden deadlocks in UI applications, and a common violation of the async programming idea of  Async factory A quite standard way for solving this problem is to use factories. We could either use the static method in   class or even specify a dedicated factory for that purpose. The second option is a little bit more compatible with the   pattern since you can request   in any class and then just call   the method.     The main drawback of this approach is additional coupling since you (any class uses  ) need to control the lifetime of a newly created object.     Additionally, it requires adapting solutions that use reflection ( ) or expressions ( ) to create and initialize instances. Async initialization We could do the following trick to avoid problems with the   pattern.     As you can see, we are beginning asynchronous initialization in the constructor and saving the reference to the started task. Then, before doing any meaningful operation, we check that   is completed by simply awaiting it. The using of this approach is very usual both in cases with a self-instantiating way of objects and IoC container. However, this approach has several drawbacks: Real example For applications to access Azure services like storage, key vault, or cognitive services, authenticating with Azure is mandatory, regardless of their deployment environment - on Azure, on-premises, or locally during development.     There are several ways it could be achieved, and one of the most secure ones is utilising the approach with the   class in .NET     That‚Äôs what Microsoft says about it     The¬† ¬†class provided by the Azure SDK allows apps to use different authentication methods depending on the environment they're run in. This allows apps to be promoted from local development to test environments to production without code changes. You configure the appropriate authentication method for each environment and¬† ¬†will automatically detect and use that authentication method. The use of¬† ¬†should be preferred over manually coding conditional logic or feature flags to use different authentication methods in different environments.     So, in order to securely store PII (Personally Identifiable Information) which can be either Full name, Phone Number, Credit card number, or Social security number, we would like to encrypt it before storing it somewhere and provide viewing original value with only limited access.     One of the possible ways is to use AzureKeyVault API for encryption and decryption.     Although there is no huge impact of creating   every time, to reduce latency and improve efficiency, it is preferable to have a single instance of it for the whole application.     So, to prepare   for encryption and decryption API, we need to have the following lines         To avoid running them on every request, we can utilise   described above         And finally, register our   with a singleton in IoC container.     Conclusion In this article, I covered several approaches for asynchronous object initialisation. Understanding requirements is the key to choosing the right approach. You can find the source code used to describe these patterns in this repository.         Thank you for reading! See you next time!

object-oriented programming,https://hackernoon.com/playwright-on-steroids-overcoming-limits-with-object-oriented-programming,"Playwright on Steroids: Overcoming Limits With Object-Oriented Programming Raffaele Florio @raffaeleflorio Too Long; Didn't Read Raffaele Florio     @ raffaeleflorio Recently, I worked on a Playwright Java project. One of its characteristics is its single-thread nature. This means we have to use a   instance in a single thread at a time. For the performance‚Äôs sake, we need to overcome this limit.     To get to the point, in the following demo, we‚Äôll expose an HTTP endpoint that screenshots a web page given its URL. And we‚Äôll build various solutions along with their benchmark when it‚Äôs useful to do so. These solutions will use the following interfaces. And they differ only by the   implementation. Unsafe solution The first and unsafe (i.e., not thread-safe) solution could be the following one.     This solution by itself is useless except in a single-thread context. So, the next step is to build a thread-safe solution. Lock based solution This solution implements the   interface considering the single-thread nature of Playwright. It composes the   and the general-purpose  . We can use   to implement another lock based   implementation on top of an unsafe one. As an example, Selenium (a library similar to Playwright) is also not thread-safe by default. Furthermore, the pattern used to compose objects is the  . According to this implementation, all the screenshot requests will be serialized because of the lock. This will impact performance. Benchmark We‚Äôll do three benchmarks with  . The siege -c parameter sets concurrent users. While the -r parameter sets how many requests each user will make. The throughput is pretty stable because that‚Äôs how much the single instance can handle. And, as a consequence, by increasing concurrent users, the response time increases. The behavior of this implementation is as we expected. On-demand solution The next solution is to try to overcome the single thread limit in a naive way. On each request, it will create a new browser instance. This implementation composes   with the general-purpose  .     According to this implementation, all the screenshot requests will be parallelized. On the surface, this seems fine. In fact, this approach is the worst. This is because each request creates a new   instance, so browser objects. This means the process will run out of memory in case of requests spike. Furthermore, we'll also delay each request because of the   instantiation process. Benchmark The following benchmarks express the weaknesses of this approach. They also impact in case of a few requests. Building on top the previous approaches The previous two approaches have both pros and cons.     Pre-instantiated Playwright objects reused across requests Serialized requests handling     Predictable resource consumption     Parallelized requests handling Delayed requests due Playwright instantiation process         Unpredictable resource consumption     Well, it seems they compensate each other. And this suggests to us another approach that mitigates weakness and boosts strengths. Indeed, we can say that a set of pre-instantiated   objects consume a predictable amount of memory. And at the same time, they can parallelize a fixed number of requests. Pool solution The aforesaid ideas translate to a pool of    objects. In the following implementation, we‚Äôll compose the general-purpose   and  . We used the latter because   objects in the pool are shared among the requests. So, we need thread-safety.     This solution seems to resolve all our issues, but it‚Äôs not true. Indeed, in case of requests spike, we cannot predict how much time a request will wait before processing. That‚Äôs because each request will be processed by a single   instance. And each instance will serialize the requests it will process. So, in case of requests spike, there will be too much contention on the single instance. It‚Äôs like we have an unbounded queue of requests per single   instance. So, to resolve this issue, we can integrate a bound. In this way, we can guarantee we can process, at most, a fixed number of requests. And this is useful because we can predict better how much time a screenshot will take. Overall, we are improving the software's predictability and quality. Semaphore solution We have many choices to implement the bounded behavior. One of them is to use a   to limit access to a single   instance. Pool and semaphore solution Finally, we need to compose the last two   implementations. In this implementation, each browser in the pool has a semaphore. We can also compose the other way around. This means a pool having a single semaphore. Benchmark The following three benchmarks are about the pool-based approach. The pool size is two. Its behavior is pretty stable. But with too many requests, the response time will start to degrade. It‚Äôs important to note we have doubled the throughput compared to the lock-based solution. This implementation worked as expected.     At this point, we can benchmark the pool and semaphore approach. The pool size is two, and the maximum number of requests bound is thirty-two. This means we can handle sixty-four requests in parallel. After reaching this limit, the service will return an unsuccessful response.     As expected, with this solution, we didn't improve performance but predictability. Indeed, the throughput is comparable to the previous solution. At the same time, the response time didn't degrade too much in case of spike. Furthermore, the concurrency value in the last benchmark reflects the maximum parallelizable requests. The price to pay to have greater predictability is a lower availability value (i.e., successful responses). Another option to implement the last solution is to use the  . Where each loop enqueues the screenshot request, then each instance in the pool dequeues a request and fulfills it. Conclusion We can consider ourselves satisfied. We overcame the single-thread limit by reaching a good level of performance. We also implemented and compared many solutions.     For simplicity‚Äôs sake, we omitted a few features required in a production-ready system. They are timeouts, asynchronous requests, exceptions handling, and a self-healing   implementation. Indeed, sometimes, Playwright objects fail. And the objective of a self-healing implementation is to restore them.     To conclude, OOP has a bad reputation in terms of performance. It‚Äôs like a rule of thumb, but it‚Äôs not true. With proper objects, we can achieve great performance by not penalizing code elegance and readability. This is not at all obvious, and it‚Äôs a great gift of OOP.

Medium:  https://medium.com/@Anatolii_Zhadan STORY‚ÄôS CREDIBILITY Guide Walkthroughs, tutorials, guides, and tips. This story will teach you how to do something new or how to do something better. In this article, I will explain classes, objects, access modifiers, constructors, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism in C++.     Hey there, future coders! Ever wondered why everyone keeps talking about OOP when it comes to C++? OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It‚Äôs like a set of rules for how to write code. It makes your life easier and your code more organized.     Imagine a  . A dog can  ,  , and  . In OOP, you‚Äôd make a   class that holds all these actions (called methods). So, next time you want a   in your program, you don‚Äôt have to write code for  ,  , and   again. You just say, ‚ÄúHey, I got a new  ,‚Äù and boom! Your new   can do all that stuff. Keep your code clean: You don‚Äôt want your room messy, right? The same goes for code. Easier to work with others: If everyone follows the same rules, no one‚Äôs stepping on each other‚Äôs toes. Saves time: Write it once, and use it many times.     Stick around, and you‚Äôll learn the basics of OOP in no time! In C++, a class is like a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes.     Here‚Äôs a simple class definition for a¬† ¬†class: By defining a class, you‚Äôre essentially creating a new data type. An object is a variable of this custom data type. You can instantiate an object from the class like so: Accessing Members You can access the data members and methods using the ¬†operator:     : With the¬† ¬†class, you can create many¬† ¬†objects, each with its own¬† ¬†and¬† or any other parameter that you will add to this class. Access modifiers Sometimes you need to protect some variables in your class, and for this, we have access modifiers in cpp, there are three types: Here,¬† ¬†is public, so you can access it directly. Here,¬† ¬†is private, so you can't access it directly. Use a public function to get it. Here,¬† ¬†is protected, so you can't access it directly. But, you can access it in a derived class.     The main difference between¬† ¬†and¬† ¬†is who can access the members:         Protected Example     In the first example,¬† ¬†can't access¬† ¬†because it's private in¬† . In the second example,¬† ¬†can access¬† ¬†because it's protected in¬† .     Constructors Constructors in C++ are special member functions that get automatically called when an object of a class is created. They usually initialize the object‚Äôs attributes. The constructor has the same name as the class and doesn‚Äôt return anything. Here‚Äôs how you can use a constructor to initialize an object. You can also pass parameters to a constructor.     You can have more than one constructor, as long as they have different parameters.     Encapsulation enhances data integrity by locking down data access to specific methods within the class. This secures your code by making variables private and providing controlled ways to modify or retrieve them through setters and getters. It also helps to manage the code more conveniently.     In this scenario, the data is exposed and can be modified directly, leaving it vulnerable to erroneous changes. In this case, the data is secured through private access, and can only be changed via specific methods that include validation checks.     Abstraction in C++ is like using a TV remote. You press the   button to turn the TV on. You don‚Äôt need to know how the TV turns on inside; you just press the button. In C++, abstraction lets you hide the complicated stuff and only show the buttons (functions) that are needed. Imagine you have to do 3 steps to start a car: turn a key, push a button, and pump gas. Instead, you can have just one   button (function) that does all those 3 steps for you. You just need to know the   button, and don‚Äôt have to worry about what happens inside. It makes it easier to work with your class.     Inheritance in C++ is similar to passing traits from parents to children. If your parent can run well, you can inherit that ability too. If you have two types of cars, both can start and stop, but they¬† ¬†can also drift. Without inheritance, you'd write two separate classes. You can make¬† ¬†a¬† ¬†of¬† . It will automatically get the ability to start and stop from its¬† .     Polymorphism is like having a universal remote that can control different devices: TV, fan, etc. You press the ‚Äúpower‚Äù button, and each device knows what to do without you having to tell it specifically. And in C++ you can have the same, so to use the same functions, but for different devices.     If you have different types of cars, each with a special way of starting, you‚Äôd have to call each one differently. in code, it will look like this: You can make all car types have a common ‚Äústart‚Äù function, so you can treat them all as just ‚Äúcars‚Äù. in code, it will look like this: With polymorphism, you just have one¬† ¬†or function, and each type of car knows what to do when you press it. This makes it simpler to manage different types of cars. Why Use Pointers in Polymorphism? Dynamic Behavior: Pointers let your program decide at run-time which version of the¬† ¬†function to use. If you have an¬† , it'll use¬† ¬†If it's just a¬† , it'll use¬† . This happens on the fly. Flexibility: By using pointers to base classes like¬† , you can write code that works for any derived class like¬† ¬†without even knowing what types of cars you might add to the program later. You can easily plug in a new type of car and your existing code will still work. Avoid Slicing: Using pointers prevents¬† , which is when you lose the unique behaviors of the derived class ( ) if you try to store it as a base class ( ). Memory Management: Pointers let you control the object‚Äôs lifetime. You can create objects when you need them and delete them when you‚Äôre done, which can help to save resources.     You mostly lose polymorphism if you don‚Äôt use pointers or references. When you use stack-allocated objects, the compiler decides at compile-time which method to call, based on the object‚Äôs declared type. This is called ‚Äústatic polymorphism‚Äù or ‚Äúcompile-time polymorphism,‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt offer the same flexibility as ‚Äúdynamic polymorphism‚Äù or ‚Äúrun-time polymorphism‚Äù that you get with pointers or references.

object-oriented programming,https://hackernoon.com/what-is-the-use-of-a-linked-list-class,"What Is the Use of a Linked List Class? Ishita Juneja @ishitajuneja Too Long; Didn't Read Ishita Juneja    @ishitajuneja     Data structures form the backbone of efficient programming and enable the organization and management of data. The linked list is a versatile and powerful tool among the various data structures. In this blog, you'll explore the linked list class and the application of a linked list.     Whether you're a beginner programmer or an experienced developer, understanding the linked list class is essential.     Let‚Äôs get started!     A linked list is a class type often used in object-oriented programming. These linked list classes are always linear in nature. Moreover, a linked list does not have any allocated memory to itself. Instead of allocated memory space, it works on a unique method.     A linked list contains multiple nodes. Each of these nodes holds data in them. Moreover, every node in a linked list is referenced to the next node with the help of a pointer.     It serves as a blueprint for creating and manipulating linked lists. It contains the necessary functionality and operations to work with linked lists efficiently.     The role of the linked list class is to allow programmers to create instances of linked lists, add or remove elements, and traverse the list. Moreover, it helps to search for specific values and perform other operations efficiently.     It encapsulates the details of memory allocation, node connections, and other low-level operations. With the help of a linked list class, programmers can make their code simple and easy to read. Moreover, it also promotes code reusability and improves the maintainability of their programs.     What Are the Applications of a Linked List?  are widely used in various programming scenarios. Their flexibility and efficiency in managing dynamic data make them a suitable class for programmers. Here are some common use cases of linked lists:     Linked lists are best to use if the data size is unknown or may change frequently. Unlike arrays with fixed sizes, linked lists offer dynamic memory allocation. It enables efficient storage of varying amounts of data. It makes them ideal for data structures that require frequent insertions or deletions.     Linked lists are used for the  , which adds and removes with the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle.     Linked lists serve as a building block for stack applications. In a stack, elements are added and removed following the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle. A linked list uses efficient push-and-pop operations, making it an excellent choice for stacks.     Linked lists play a crucial role in graph algorithms. These are used to represent graph nodes and their connections. Graph traversal algorithms such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) heavily rely on linked lists to store and traverse graph nodes. Linked lists provide an efficient way to represent the edges between nodes in a graph.     Memory management is the best application of a linked list. Linked lists are employed in memory management tasks in programming languages. For example, in garbage collection algorithms, linked lists are used to keep track of allocated memory blocks. When memory blocks are deallocated, they can be efficiently managed and reused using a linked list data structure.     Another linked list application is finding usage in file systems to organize and manage file data. File systems use linked lists to maintain the hierarchy of directories and files. Each directory contains a linked list of files and subdirectories. It enables flawless navigation and management of file data.     Linked lists commonly represent polynomials in mathematics and computer science. Each node in the linked list represents a term in the polynomial, containing the coefficient and the degree of the term. The linked list allows easy manipulation of polynomial terms, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.     This application of a linked list is about managing dynamic tasks or processes. Each node in the linked list represents a task, and the links connect the tasks in the desired order or priority. It is helpful in job scheduling, task management systems, and event-driven programming applications.     What Are the Best Practices for Applying a Linked List? While using linked lists, you should note these best practices. These points will result in the efficient application of a linked list.     Before using a linked list, understand your application's specific requirements and characteristics. Evaluate whether a linked list is the appropriate data structure for your needs.     Linked lists require dynamic memory allocation for each node. Make sure to allocate memory when adding new nodes and deallocate memory when removing or when the linked list is no longer needed. Failing to manage memory properly can lead to memory leaks or other memory-related issues.     Instead of frequently allocating and deallocating memory for nodes, consider reusing nodes whenever possible. Reusing nodes can improve memory management and reduce the overhead of memory allocation.     Take advantage of the flexibility of linked lists by using insertion and deletion techniques. For example, to insert a node at the beginning of the list, simply update the head pointer to the new node, avoiding trailing the entire list.     Similarly, for deletion, update the appropriate pointers to bypass the node to be removed. These techniques can significantly improve the performance of linked list operations.     As with any data structure or algorithm, test your implementation of linked lists. Check the correctness and efficiency of the operations, especially when dealing with edge cases or large data sets. Conducting proper testing ensures the reliability and stability of your linked list implementation.     Efficient application of a linked list in your programs can improve your program. It increases the performance and reusability of the program along with easy maintenance. Constant practice of linked lists will make you good at programming and will also help in enhancing your career.

SOLID Principles is a coding standard that all developers should have a clear concept for developing software in a proper way to avoid a bad design. It was promoted by Robert C Martin and is used across the object-oriented design spectrum. When applied properly it makes your code more extendable, logical and easier to read. 
Method overloading and overriding are two common forms of polymorphism ( the ability for a method or class to have multiple forms) in C# that are often confused because of their similar sounding names. In this article, we show the difference between the two with some practical code examples. 
This post contains a step-by-step example of a refactoring session guided by tests. When dealing with untested or legacy code refactoring is dangerous and tests can help us do it the right way, minimizing the amount of bugs we introduce, and possibly completely avoiding them.
